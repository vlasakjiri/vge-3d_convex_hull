# 3D Convex hull algorithms showcase

This is a project for Computational Geometry course in Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technologies.

Project showcases 3 algorithms for computing convex hull in 3D. Quick hull, iterative algorithm and bruteforce algorithm. Iterative algorithm implementation was ported from [Dung Han Lee's repository](https://github.com/Dung-Han-Lee/Convexhull-3D-Implementation-of-incremental-convexhull-algorithm). All algorithms are visualized in Three.js.
